Elnys,no,Dwarf,Cleric,"Elnys is plagued with terrible social anxiety due to years spent reading books alone. Unfortunately, Elnys incorrectly committed them to memory and will occasionally quote holy words of Moradin...incorrectly. Elnys also lost a toe to a terrible infection at a young age, and as a result hates feet in any context. Times blown up/exploded/burned 🔥: 2"
